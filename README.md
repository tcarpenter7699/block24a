# Workshop - Autocorrect

In this workshop, you will be writing higher order functions to implement a basic autocorrect algorithm. The key concepts behind this algorithm are _relevance_ and _distance_. Given a string to correct, we first choose _relevant_ strings from a larger set, and then of that subset, we select the _closest_ option.
